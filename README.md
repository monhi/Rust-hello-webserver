# Rust-hello-webserver
This project is based on Rust book final project.
You can find the book at the following address:

<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" target="_blank" >Rust official book</a>

The final project is very good because it gives very good information about how to implement a simple web server that answers some web requests by using some thread pools
I would like to improve this project to add some new capabilities to it.
For that, I make a repo for it.
